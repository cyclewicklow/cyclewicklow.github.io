If you have a hobby, then the answer is pretty easy and probably automatic. However, if you don’t have a hobby, this can lead to feelingly slightly uncomfortable or an awkward excuse for not having a hobby. I never realized the value of a hobby until I actually found mine, programming and content creation. Having found my hobbies, I encourage people to find their own, and I have a few reasons why.<br><br>
<b>Hobbies Stimulate Your Mind</b><br><br>
I’ve talked a lot about the knowledge you gain through hobbies, but think about how this improves your mental wellness. We generally choose hobbies that keep us thinking, maybe it’s a theory of which direction our favorite show is going to go, or which hiking trail is most likely to keep you alive.
As long ad your mind has a problem to solve, you are keeping it busy. Without any problems to solve, your mind doesn’t need to work, and that pretty much makes you braindead.
So get out there and find a hobby that works for you. It can be literally anything you want it to be, as long as it’s something YOU want to do.
